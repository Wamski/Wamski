# Hi there 👋
I'm Jon Wasky and this is my profile. I am majoring in Computer Science and I am expected to graduate in Spring of 2026.

## Projects
### 🏎️ Tiny Karts
Tiny Karts is a small time trial racing game similar to Mario Kart that me and a group of two others developed in High School as a final Project. This project introduced me to programming in C# and Unity 3D and inspired me to pursue this field. Tiny Karts had a strict deadline of two months and was to be presented at Sinclair College's Tech Prep Showcase.

### 🌙 Moonlit (In Progress)
Moonlit is a small scoped game that I have been working on over winter break and during my free time. Moonlit as of 01/09/25 is currently a souls-like boss room with the graphics and stylization taking inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.  

Working:
 - Player:
    - Locomotion Script
    - Animation Handler
    - Player Stats Script (Health, Stamina)
    - Enemy Targeting (WIP)
      - Can Target 1 Enemy but needs to be able to switch between multiple.
  - Boss:
    - NavMeshAI
      - Locomotion (Patroling, Chasing, Attacking)
      - Animation Handling
