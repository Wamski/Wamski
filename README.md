## Hi there 👋
I'm Jon Wasky and this is my profile
- 🎓I'm majoring in Computer Science

Some Projects I'm working on are
- 🏎️ TinyKartz
  - TinyKartz originally was a project I started in Highschool with a group of two others. The game ran using Unity and C#. Since then I've gained more knowledge of C# and have decided to completely rewrite the game. 
- 🕹️ Un-named Action Adventure Game
  - I haven't fully fleshed out all of the details to this game just that the art style is going to be similar to The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.
  - I've created a few models for the game, and started working on animations. It has a working player locomotion controller.
