## Hi there 👋
I'm Jon Wasky and this is my profile
- 🎓I'm majoring in Computer Science

Some Projects I'm working on are
- 🏎️ TinyKartz
  - TinyKartz originally was a project I started in Highschool with a group of two others. The game ran using Unity and C#. Since then I've gained more knowledge of C# and have decided to completely rewrite the game. 
- 🕹️ Un-named 2D platformer
  - The goal of this game is to complete a level within 26 seconds by mastering jumps and special abilities.
